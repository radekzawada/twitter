# requirments

A small homework: Imagine that you don't want to or just don't have enough time to go through entire Twitter timeline every day and you are only interested in URLs to the various resources that are submitted by the people you follow (e.g., to blog posts). Implement a script that solves that problem and returns all tweets containing URLs. You should be able to specify either since when you want to fetch tweets or between what timestamps. Make it executable and runnable from console returning a nicely formatted result. The output should include the URLs themselves, date and some info indicating what it is about (especially for shortened URLs). Treat it as a real-world feature and send us a link to the repo.
